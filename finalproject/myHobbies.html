  <li> HIKING </li> 
 <p> I am an avid hiker. I try to go as often as every week; at a minimum every other week. <br>
     I love the feeling of completion when you get to the top of a tough portion.<br>
     No one can argue that a hard hike usually finishes with a breathtaking view</p>
     
  <li> READING </li>   
 <p> Recently, I would much rather get caught up in a great book then watch a TV show. <br> 
     Immersing myself entirely with a story for hours on end is simply wonderful. </p> 

  <li> LISTENING TO MUSIC </li> 
 <p> I have countless playlists on my Spotify that are applicable to many different circumstances. <br>
     I love just hitting shuffle on a playlist that fits whatever mood I am in, <br> 
     then simply listening. </p>

  <li> BIKING </li> 
 <p> There is no better feeling then speeding down a hill in a bicycle. I often compare it to <br> 
     flying in my head. A quick bike to the park with a good book (see above hobby) and the day <br>
     is instantly made better.</p>
